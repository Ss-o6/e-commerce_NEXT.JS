## Rendering Strategies Used and Reasons

Home Page (/) ‚Äì Uses Static Site Generation (SSG) through getStaticProps.
The product list on the home page doesn‚Äôt change frequently, so it is generated at build time for fast loading and better performance.

Product Details Page (/products/[slug]) ‚Äì Uses SSG with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
Each product page is pre-rendered once and automatically updated after a set time interval, keeping the data fresh without rebuilding the whole site.

Dashboard Page (/dashboard) ‚Äì Uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) through getServerSideProps.
The dashboard shows live product and inventory information, so it needs to fetch new data from the server every time the page loads.

Admin Panel (/admin) ‚Äì Uses Client-Side Rendering (CSR).
Admin login, authentication, and product management are handled entirely on the client side using React state and API requests.

Wishlist Page (/wishlist) ‚Äì Uses Client-Side Rendering (CSR).
The wishlist is stored in the browser‚Äôs localStorage and updated directly on the client side, so it doesn‚Äôt require any server-side rendering.
